## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

here is a link to [Google](http://google.com)

here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__

here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

when we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

here are some example R commands: 

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Here is an example of a non-numbered list: 

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice
    
> Here is an example of a block quote. This 
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote
> 2. Second item. 
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of code in a blockquote using 5 spaces:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y =   \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 $$
